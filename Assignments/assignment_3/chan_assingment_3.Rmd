```{r}
# bring in autopower function

```

## Add an additional super light car with mass 5,000 kg and a surface area 10m2
```{r}
# from looping.rmd: generate a structure to store info on our possible cars, add an additional car
possible_cars = data.frame(name = c("A","B","C", "D"),mass=c(10000,65000,38000, 5000), area = c(22,30,22, 10))
```

## Compute the mean and maximum power for Cars A, B, C and for your new car, assuming that average highway speed is 80 km/hr with a standard deviation of 10km/hr; Use 2 different methods to compute the mean and maximum power for each car type; a) FOR loop and b) the pmap function from purr
```{r}
# using a for loop to calculate the mean power for each car 
mean_func <- function(v=80, m, A) {
  mean_power = autopower()
}
```
